File Management at remote side <br />

Step 1: git clone https://github.com/dungbkhn/PersonalDataStoreWebInterface.git <br />
 
Step 2: cd PersonalDataStoreWebInterface <br />

Step 3: run these commands: <br />
sudo apt install nodejs <br />
sudo apt install npm <br />
npm install find express multer <br />
        
Step 4: start server by command: <br /> 
node server.js  <br />       
        
Ok, server is set up at <server_ip>:1999, try to connect to it with username:hello and password:1234. Note that remote server uses certificate not-proved, so the browser will ask to back for safety, you can ignore it and continue to proceed anyway. <br />

Enjoy it!
